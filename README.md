# Autoplay And Shuffle for Pixabay Music via Userscript

Pixabay Music is a great source of royalty-free tracks, but it lacks basic streaming features like autoplay and shuffleâ€”features you'd expect from platforms like YouTube Music or Spotify.

This userscript adds those missing features by automatically playing music and redirecting to a random track when one ends or when a track ID is invalid (404). It transforms Pixabay Music into a lightweight, self-shuffling music stream.

## ðŸŽ§ Features

- **Autoplay**: Automatically plays the track when the page loads.
- **Shuffle**: Redirects to a random track after the current one ends.
- - **404 Not Found Handling**: If a generated track ID is not available (e.g. 404 or missing), the script automatically redirects to a new random ID track.
- **Custom ID Range**: Easily configure `minId` and `maxId` at the top of the script to control the range of track IDs.

## ðŸ›  Installation

1. **Install Tampermonkey** (or any userscript manager)  
   - [Tampermonkey for Chrome](https://tampermonkey.net/?ext=dhdg&browser=chrome)  
   - [Tampermonkey for Firefox](https://tampermonkey.net/?ext=dhdg&browser=firefox)

2. **Install the script**  
   - Copy the code from [`Pixabay Music Autoplay + Shuffle`](https://github.com/l1145a1/Autoplay-Shuffle-for-Pixabay-Music-via-Userscript)  
   - Create a new script in Tampermonkey and paste the code.

3. **Customize ID range (optional)**  
   - At the top of the script, modify:
     ```javascript
     const minId = 1000;
     const maxId = 999999;
     ```
   - This controls the range of random track IDs used for shuffle and recovery.

## ðŸ’¡ Notes

- This script assumes that Pixabay Music track URLs follow the format:  
  `https://pixabay.com/id/music/{id}/`
- Not all numeric IDs are valid. The script handles this by detecting 404 pages and retrying with a new random ID.
- You can tweak the logic to cache successful IDs or log failed attempts if needed.
